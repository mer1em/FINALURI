The purpose of this application is to provide the user with a list of the best and worst
countries to travel to,and it is also possible to book a plane ticket. The list of countries was created using recyclerview. 
Each country has 3 buttons cases news and flag itself, which, when clicked, open the corresponding page in the browser(clicking on a flag opens
countrys wikipedia page. In the app we also use realtime database, while logging in and entering your name it gets uploaded to database servers.
When authenticating, also firebase services were used, which was assembled using Single activity architecture.
We also have a booking page where user can enter all their information e.g country they want to travel to, credit card info and so on..
this also opens gmail app where all the info entered in our app gets transfered here.
The about page has a contact textview when clicked takes you to our facebook page.
